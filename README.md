# synth.download

synth.download automation for some things via github actions, to see any sources refer to [synth.download's forgejo](https://forged.synth.download) or just check out [synth.download](https://synth.download) itself.

## why not just do it yourself

i'm running out of available resources to do things myself and i'd like automation

## why not your own git instance

see above, and github lets me take up space in their server room to do things free of charge so win win to me
